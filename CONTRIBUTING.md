# Contributing

<strong>TL;DR</strong>

1. Submit feedback via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/issues)
2. Participate in conversations via [Discord](https://discord.gg/nUMUjdyMJH)
3. Contribute to our documentation by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/KickEngineering/kickdevdocs) 

If you've made it here, thank you for wanting to contribute to our project!

We want the feedback process to be easy and streamlined. We have setup a single source of truth for feedback through our [public GitHub documentation repository](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs). This repository directly feeds back to this documentation website which allows you to edit and give feedback on the documentation and therefore the API.

Help us create and improve this product! We want your input and we want your feedback!

## GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/issues) is where feedback can be raised for us to consider. If you have feedback on our documentation, see if other people have raised the same idea and give us your thoughts!

We are looking for the following:

* Bug reports
* Feature requests
* Endpoint requests

## Discord

Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nUMUjdyMJH) is the location for back and forth conversations with other like-minded developers about the API.

Discuss how you've done something, ask questions, answer questions and showcase your work to the community!

## Documentation

Please help improve our docs! See something that isn't correct? See a typo that's bothering you?

You can contribute yourself by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/pulls).


## Developer Email 
For anything that is not covered above please feel free to send us an email at developers@kick.com 
Please note: All bugs and feature requests must go through GitHub Issues, please only use this email for other support related queries.
