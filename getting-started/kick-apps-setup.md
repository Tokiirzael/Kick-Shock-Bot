# App Setup

Create an app with KICK by following the below steps:

* Step 1
  * Sign up for a KICK account if you havenâ€™t already. 
  * Make sure to review our Developer Terms and Conditions to ensure your app complies with our access policies.
  
* Step 2: Enable 2FA
  * Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to access our developer tools from your Kick Account settings.
* Step 3: Navigate to the KICK Developer Tab
  * Go to your Account Settings and select the [Developer](https://kick.com/settings/developer) tab.

* Step 4: Create Your App
  * Create an app to securely access our APIs via OAuth. This will generate a unique ClientID, ClientSecret, and a redirectURL specified by you.
  * Upon successful authorization, KICK will redirect control to your redirectURL with a code to complete the [OAuth 2.0 Code Grant flow with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce).
  
  
* Step 5: Build Your App
  * Use our documentation to guide you through the app development process.
  
* Step 6: Launch Your App ðŸš€
